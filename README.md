# GBAPong

Pong game for the gameboy advance.

To create this game, I have used the dev environment found in this [github repository](https://github.com/DylanMeeus/Ubuntu16.04_devkitpro_gba).

There are some references to more resources about gameboy advance development in the comments in the code.

This game was tested using the mednafen GBA emulator. The multiplayer part of the game is not really feasable on an actual device, but on the computer you can play it with two people rather easily by choosing a good key mapping in your emulator.

A video of the multiplayer version of this game being played can be found [here](https://vimeo.com/217093599).
